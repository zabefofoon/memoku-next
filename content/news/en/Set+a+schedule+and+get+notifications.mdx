After registering a task, choose a date and time to set a deadline.
Memoku will send a notification at the scheduled time.  
  
Manage your tasks by time to be even more effective.  
<hr/>
1. Open the time settings  
On the list page, click the time area of a task.

<img 
    className='w-full max-w-[500px] aspect-[5/3] rounded-xl | border border-gray-300 dark:border-zinc-600' 
    src='/images/contents/push/push_card.webp' 
    alt=''
/>

2. Set date/time and end date  
If you set a date and time without selecting a weekday, a one-time notification is scheduled.

<img 
    className='w-full max-w-[500px] aspect-[5/3] rounded-xl | border border-gray-300 dark:border-zinc-600' 
    src='/images/contents/push/push_reserve.webp' 
    alt=''
/>

3. Set repeating weekdays  
If you select weekdays and a time, notifications are scheduled at that time every week.

<img 
    className='w-full max-w-[500px] aspect-[5/3] rounded-xl | border border-gray-300 dark:border-zinc-600' 
    src='/images/contents/push/push_reserve2.webp' 
    alt=''
/>
